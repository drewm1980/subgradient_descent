subgradient_descent
===================

Writeup on subgradient descent L1 minimization

WARNING!!! This idea has not turned out to be efficient for very many cases, and has issues with the optimization blowing up right as it converges.

Furthermore, the expression for the derivative can be simplified considerably, and I haven't written that up yet.
